README for BOOTALL 97
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the readme of BOOTALL 97

What is BOOTALL?
BOOTALL is a boot manager for pc harddisks. It can boot nearly every operation
system from primary AND logical partitions.

Why BOOTALL, OS/2 Boot Manager does the same?
BOOTALL does not need his own partition. OS/2 occupies one socket in the master
boot record, so that you only can add 3 more partitions. BOOTALL is stored in
the remaining sectors of track 0 head 0. This area is normally not used by any
partition. OS/2 Boot Manager needs at least 2 MB of memory. BOOTALL needs 2 KB 
on your harddisk.

How to install BOOTALL?
The program CONFIG.EXE is used to install and configure BOOTALL. To be sure 
nothing is damaged you should make a backup of your harddisk before
installing BOOTALL. At least you should save your master boot record on disk
to restore it after an accident.

Adding partitions to the menu?
When you want to change the existing partitions (add, remove, etc.). You should
run CONFIG.EXE again and modify the entries.
